
# Number of ENI for each instance type

In AWS, the number of Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) you can attach to an EC2 instance depends on the instance type. Each instance type has a different limit for the maximum number of ENIs. Here are some general guidelines for the most common instance types:
t2.micro, t3.micro: 2 ENIs
t2.medium, t3.medium: 3 ENIs
m4.large, m5.large: 3 ENIs
m4.xlarge, m5.xlarge: 4 ENIs
c4.large, c5.large: 3 ENIs
c4.xlarge, c5.xlarge: 4 ENIs
r4.large, r5.large: 3 ENIs
r4.xlarge, r5.xlarge: 4 ENIs
-----------------------------------------
# Number of IPs for each ENI

The number of IP addresses required for each Elastic Network Interface (ENI) in AWS depends on the number of secondary private IP addresses you assign to it. Here's a general guideline:
Primary IP Address: Each ENI must have exactly one primary private IP address.
Secondary IP Addresses: You can optionally assign additional (secondary) private IP addresses to an ENI.
The maximum number of private IP addresses (including the primary one) that can be assigned to an ENI depends on the instance type. Here is a summary of the maximum number of private IP addresses per ENI for some instance types:
t2.micro, t3.micro: 2 IPs (1 primary + 1 secondary)
t2.medium, t3.medium: 6 IPs (1 primary + 5 secondary)
m4.large, m5.large: 10 IPs (1 primary + 9 secondary)
m4.xlarge, m5.xlarge: 15 IPs (1 primary + 14 secondary)
c4.large, c5.large: 10 IPs (1 primary + 9 secondary)
c4.xlarge, c5.xlarge: 15 IPs (1 primary + 14 secondary)
r4.large, r5.large: 10 IPs (1 primary + 9 secondary)
r4.xlarge, r5.xlarge: 15 IPs (1 primary + 14 secondary)
